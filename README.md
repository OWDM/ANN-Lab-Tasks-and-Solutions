# ANN-Lab-Tasks-and-Solutions

A comprehensive repository containing lab tasks and solutions for Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Designed to facilitate learning and application of ANN concepts through practical tasks and examples.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a resource for students and enthusiasts interested in exploring and understanding Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) through hands-on lab tasks and solutions. It features a collection of 8 Word documents detailing lab tasks, accompanied by 8 Jupyter Notebook files providing detailed solutions and explanations.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

- `Lab Tasks`: Contains 8 Word documents, each outlining a specific lab task designed to challenge and enhance your understanding of ANN concepts.
- `Lab Solved`: Comprises 8 Jupyter Notebook files (`*.ipynb`), each corresponding to a lab task and providing a comprehensive solution with code, explanations, and visualizations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the lab tasks and solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. If not, you can install it via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or by running `pip install notebook`.
3. Navigate to the `Lab Solved` folder and open the Jupyter Notebook files to view the solutions.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary Python libraries as specified in the notebooks (e.g., `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow`).

## Usage

To make the most out of this repository:

- Start by reviewing the lab tasks in the `Lab Tasks` folder.
- Attempt to solve the tasks on your own to reinforce your learning.
- Refer to the corresponding solution in the `Lab Solved` folder for guidance, detailed explanations, and code insights.
